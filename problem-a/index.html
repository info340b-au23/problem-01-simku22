    <p>Zeus, a sky and weather god, was the centre of many ancient Greek and Cretan myths. Within <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology">Greek Mythology</a></cite>, he is a "Father" to all gods and humans alike. He is associated with stormy and cloudy weather, and often wields lightning and thunder as a symbol of protection and power. </p>
    <p>Zeus's Many Talents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="important-list-item">The ability to quite literally wield lightning bolts</li>
        <li>Performed some pretty epic justice upon Sisyphus, who will be rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity.</li>
        <li>Successfully averted insurrection attempts by lesser gods multiple times</li>
    </ul>
